# Hive

Workspace chat hub with multi-bot, multi-provider support. A Rust daemon serves an HTTP API and React SPA, connecting you to AI bots (Claude, Codex, Gemini) that can chat, watch for signals, run on schedules, and coordinate swarm workers.

## Install

### From GitHub Releases (preferred for macOS)

Download the latest binary from [Releases](https://github.com/ApiariTools/hive/releases):

```bash
chmod +x hive-aarch64-apple-darwin
mv hive-aarch64-apple-darwin /usr/local/bin/hive
hive init my-project
hive --port 4200
```

Signed release binaries are the preferred install method for macOS, especially if you use Hive remotes over local-LAN IPs. Future Homebrew distribution should install these release artifacts rather than asking users to build locally.

### From crates.io

Good for local development and Rust-heavy workflows:

```bash
cargo install apiari-hive
hive init my-project
hive --port 4200
```

On recent macOS versions, locally built or `cargo install`ed binaries may hit local-network privacy quirks when connecting to LAN remotes. Hive includes a `/usr/bin/curl` fallback for remote HTTP, but signed release binaries remain the more reliable default.

### From Source

Requires Rust 1.85+ and Node 20+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ApiariTools/hive.git
cd hive
cd web && npm install && npx vite build && cd ..
cargo install --path .
hive init my-project
hive --port 4200
```

For day-to-day macOS development, prefer the signed dev launcher:

```bash
./scripts/run-signed-hive.sh --port 4200
```

It rebuilds Hive, applies an ad hoc signature, and then `exec`s the signed binary.

### Prerequisites

- At least one provider CLI installed (e.g. `claude`)
- Optional: `gh` CLI (for GitHub watch bots), `swarm` CLI (for worker integration)

Open `http://localhost:4200` in your browser.

### Configure a Workspace

Create `~/.config/hive/workspaces/my-project.toml`:

```toml
[workspace]
root = "/path/to/my-project"
name = "my-project"
description = "My awesome project"

[[bots]]
name = "CI Watch"
color = "#e85555"
role = "Monitor CI and investigate failures"
provider = "claude"
watch = ["github"]
```

Reload the app — your workspace and bots appear automatically.

## Configuration

Workspace configs live in `~/.config/hive/workspaces/{name}.toml`. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full schema.

Optional context files in your project root:
- `.apiari/context.md` — Project context appended to all bot prompts
- `.apiari/soul.md` — Communication style for bots

## Bots

**Passive** — Chat-only bots that respond to your messages. Every bot works this way by default.

**Watch** — Poll external sources (currently GitHub PRs with failing CI) and respond autonomously. Add `watch = ["github"]` to a bot config.

**Scheduled** — Run on an interval to generate reports. Configure with `schedule_hours` and `proactive_prompt`:

```toml
[[bots]]
name = "Weekly Review"
role = "Code quality reviewer"
schedule_hours = 168
proactive_prompt = "Review recent PRs and summarize code quality trends"
```

## Development

### Setup hooks

```bash
git config core.hooksPath hooks
```

This configures git to use the `hooks/` directory for git hooks, including a `pre-push` hook that runs all checks (fmt, clippy, test, tsc, vitest, vite build) before allowing pushes.

```bash
# Run checks
cargo fmt && cargo clippy -- -D warnings -A clippy::too_many_arguments && cargo test

# Run a locally built, signed Hive binary on macOS
./scripts/run-signed-hive.sh --port 4200

# Frontend
cd web
npm install
npm run dev        # dev server
npx tsc --noEmit   # type check
npx vitest run     # tests
```

## Architecture

Rust axum daemon serves the API and a bundled React SPA. SQLite (WAL mode) stores conversations, sessions, bot status, and unread tracking. A WebSocket endpoint pushes real-time updates to the frontend.

Bot responses stream through provider SDKs (`apiari-claude-sdk`, `apiari-codex-sdk`, `apiari-gemini-sdk`) in background tasks. Session management uses prompt hashing — if the config or context files change, sessions reset automatically.

When a `.swarm/` directory exists in the workspace root, bots gain the ability to dispatch and monitor swarm workers — autonomous coding agents that run in git worktrees.
